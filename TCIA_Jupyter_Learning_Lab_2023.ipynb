However HIPAA constraints make sharing medical images outside an individual institution a complex process. [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) TCIA is a public service funded by the National Cancer Institute which addresses this challenge by providing hosting and de-identification services to take major burdens of data sharing off researchers.\n",

Recognizing that images alone are not enough to conduct meaningful research, most collections are linked to rich supporting data including patient outcomes, treatment information, genomic / proteomic analyses, and expert image analyses (segmentations, annotations, and radiomic / radiogenomic features). **In this course we will address a variety of use cases for identifying TCIA datasets of interest and downloading them via Jupyter Notebooks.**\n",
