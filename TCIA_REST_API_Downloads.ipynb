    "1. [NBIA Search REST APIs](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/fILTB) that allow you to perform basic queries and download data from **public** collections. This API does not require a TCIA account.\n",

    "3. [NBIA Advanced REST APIs](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/YoATBg) that allow access to **public and limited-access** collections, but provide query endpoints mostly geared towards developers seeking to integrate searching and downloading TCIA data into web and desktop applications.

    "\n",
    "**tcia_utils** contains a **downloadSeries()** function that has multiple options for specifying the seriesUids you'd like to download.  By default, the function expects JSON data containing \"SeriesInstanceUID\" elements, which can be generated using **getSeries()** or **getCart()**.  However, if you have a series UID list from some other source, you can set **input_type = \"list\"** to pass a python list of one or more series UIDs instead of JSON. You can also set **input_type = \"manifest\"** and provide a path to a **.TCIA** manifest file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are saved to a **tciaDownload** folder in your current working directory by default, but you can use the **path** parameter to change this to a different directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an optional **format** parameter that can be used to return metadata about what was downloaded.  It can be set to **df** to return dataframe or **csv** to save a spreadsheet. There's also a **csv_filename** parameter if you want to set a specific file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify **number = n** to tell the function to only download the first **n** scans of your seriesUids.  Remove this parameter in the examples below to download the full dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **api_url** parameter can be omitted in most cases.  However, it must be set to **api_url = \"nlst\"** to access the [National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)](https://doi.org/10.7937/TCIA.HMQ8-J677) collection and you must use **api_url = \"restricted\"** for datasets that require logging in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, there is some logic built in to detect whether you've already downloaded a series.  If a directory named after the seriesUid already exists the function will assume it's already been downloaded and skip that series."
