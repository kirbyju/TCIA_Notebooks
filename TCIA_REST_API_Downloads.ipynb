        "3. [NBIA Advanced REST APIs](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/YoATBg) that allow access to **public and limited-access** collections, but provide query endpoints mostly geared towards developers seeking to integrate searching and downloading TCIA data into web and desktop applications.  This API requires a TCIA account for creation of authentication tokens.\n",

However, if you have a series UID list from some other source, you can set **input_type = \"list\"** to pass a python list of one or more series UIDs instead of JSON. You can also set **input_type = \"manifest\"** to provide a path to a **.TCIA** manifest file.\n",
