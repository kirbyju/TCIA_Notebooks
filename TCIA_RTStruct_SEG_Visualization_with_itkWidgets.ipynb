        "# Summary\n",
        "Access to large, high-quality data is essential for researchers to understand disease and precision medicine pathways, especially in cancer. However, HIPAA constraints make sharing medical images outside an individual institution a complex process. [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) is a public service funded by the National Cancer Institute that addresses this challenge by providing hosting and de-identification services to take major burdens of data sharing off researchers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## DICOM Image Objects\n",
        "Most of TCIA data is available as DICOM objects. A wide variety of toolkits are able to read DICOM images, but fewer are able to convert them into volumetric representations, and still fewer correctly maintain the metadata necessary to interpret how that volume maps into physical space (i.e., its origin, axis orientation, and the physical distance between its voxels).  Such information is critical to subsequent analysis of those images.\n",
        "\n",
        "[ITK](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK) is used to read DICOM images.\n",
        "\n",
        "## DICOM SEG and RTStruct Objects\n",
        "There are often DICOM SEG (labelmap) and DICOM RTStruct (contour) files that provide annotations for the DICOM images.  Reading and mapping those objects onto medical images, and converting contours to labelmaps and preserving the origin, spacing, and direction information in those labelmaps can also be challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Herein, we explore a common AI research workflow.  We demonstrate basic methods for downloading DICOM objects from TCIA, converting them into images and labelmaps, and visualizing them within this Jupyter Notebook using itkWidgets.   \n",
        "\n",
        "[RT-Utils](https://github.com/qurit/rt-utils) (built on top of pydicom) is used to convert RTStruct contours to labelmaps.\n",
        "\n",
        "[pydicom-seg](https://github.com/razorx89/pydicom-seg) (also built on top of pydicom) is used to convert SEG labelmaps to images.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Visualization\n",
        "While Jupyter systems (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, AWS SageMaker, etc.) are outstanding tools for interactive programming and algorithm sharing, the ability to visualize data within them has traditionally be limited to plots and sparse 2D slices - which are insufficient when dealing with 3D clinical data. This limitation is particularly challenging when using cloud-based jupyter systems such as Google Colab and AWS SageMaker. 3D interactive visualization of data when using those cloud systems traditionally requires downloading that data to your local machine and then running a separate visualization application. itkWidgets addresses those visualization challenges by providing interacitve 3D (and 2D) visualizations within the cells of your Jupyter scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "[itkWidgets](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets) is used to visualize images, point sets, and 3D geometry in Jupyter systems (Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, AWS SageMaker, and Google Colab). Despite its name, itkWidgets does not require the use of ITK. It can directly visualize numpy arrays, torch tensors, DASK arrays, VTK polydata, and a multitude of other Python data structures."
