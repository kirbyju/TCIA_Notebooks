        "The PROSTATEx Challenge (\"SPIE-AAPM-NCI Prostate MR Classification Challenge”) focused on  quantitative image analysis methods for the diagnostic classification of clinically significant prostate cancers and was held in conjunction with the 2017 SPIE Medical Imaging Symposium.  PROSTATEx ran from November 21, 2016 to January 15, 2017, though a \"live\" version has also been established at https://prostatex.grand-challenge.org  which serves as an ongoing way for researchers to benchmark their performance for this task.\n",

Columns include a wide variety of DICOM metadata of potential use including Patient IDs, Study UIDs, Series UIDs, Study Descriptions, Study Dates, Series Descriptions, Image Modality, Scanner Manufacturer, Number of Images per Scan and more.\n",

The files are then assigned numbers with the lowest acquisition being 1 and the lowest instance number within that acquisition being 1, separated by a dash. The numbers are incremented by 1 as the next values are encountered. All values are left-padded with zeros to provide for the ordering within the file system. \n",

The last file in that acquisition would be 1-42.dcm.  Then the second acquisition would start with 2-01.dcm, ending with 2-42.dcm, in that acquisition. For the purposes of ordering, an empty value in either acquisition number or instance number is lower than a file having a value for those number."
