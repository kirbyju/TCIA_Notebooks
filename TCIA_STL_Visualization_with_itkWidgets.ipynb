    "# Summary\n",
    "Interactive visualization of data is essential to gaining new insights into problem domains, verifying image processing pipelines, and evaluating experimental results. TCIA provides a vast quantity of high-quality clinical data for such work. itkWidgets provides methods for visualizing TCIA's data within Python notebooks, whether they are running locally or in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the visualization of \"non-traditional\" data stored in TCIA.  Other notebooks in this repository demonstrate the visualization of DICOM, SEG, and RTStruct objects.  Herein, we demonstrate the visualization of STL files that are commonly used in 3D printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) is a public service funded by the National Cancer Institute that addresses this challenge by providing hosting and de-identification services to take major burdens of data sharing off researchers. Its rich collection of clinical data and annotations is particularly powerful as a community resource when it is paired with interactive code systems, such as Jupyter systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Jupyter systems (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google CoLab, Amazon SageMaker, etc.) are outstanding tools for interactive programming and algorithm sharing, the ability to visualize data within them has traditionally be limited to plots and sparse 2D slices, which are insufficient when dealing with 3D clinical data. This limitation is particularly challenging when using cloud-based Jupyter systems such as Google Colab and Amazon SageMaker.  3D interactive visualization of data when using those cloud systems traditionally requires downloading that data to your local machine and then running a separate visualization application. itkWidgets addresses these visualization challenges by providing interacitve 3D (and 2D) visualizations within the cells of your Jupyter scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "[itkWidgets](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets) allows researchers to visualize images, point sets, and 3D geometry in Jupyter systems (Jupyer Notebook, JupyterLab, Amazon SageMaker, and Google Colab). Despite its name, itkWidgets does not require the use of ITK. It can directly visualize numpy arrays, torch tensors, DASK arrays, VTK polydata, and a multitude of other Python data structures.  It is open source and freely available with the Apache 2.0 license.\n",
    "\n",
    "[VTK](https://vtk.org) is a freely available, open-source library for scientific visualization.  It is available in C++, Python, JavaScript, and several other languages.  In this notebook, we include it for its ability to read STL files."
