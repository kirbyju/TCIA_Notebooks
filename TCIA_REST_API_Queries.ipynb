        "3. The [NBIA Advanced REST APIs](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/YoATBg) also allow access to **public and limited-access** collections, but provide query endpoints mostly geared towards developers seeking to integrate searching and downloading TCIA data into web and desktop applications. This API requires a TCIA account to create authentication tokens.\n",
