        "**tcia_utils** contains a **downloadSeries()** function that has multiple options for specifying the seriesUids you'd like to download.  By default, the function expects JSON data containing \"SeriesInstanceUID\" elements, which can be generated using **getSeries()** or **getCart()**.  However, if you have a series UID list from some other source, you can set **input_type = \"list\"** to pass a python list of one or more series UIDs instead of JSON.  You can also set **input_type = \"manifest\"** to pass the path of a *.TCIA manifest file as series_data.\n",

        "\n",
        "There is an optional **format** parameter that can be used to return metadata about what was downloaded.  It can be set to **df** to return dataframe or **csv** to save a spreadsheet. There's also a **csv_filename** parameter if you want to set a specific file name.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can specify **number = n** to tell the function to only download the first **n** scans of your seriesUids.  Remove this parameter in the examples below to download the full dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **api_url** parameter can be omitted in most cases.  However, it must be set to **api_url = \"nlst\"** to access the [National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)](https://doi.org/10.7937/TCIA.HMQ8-J677) collection and you must use **api_url = \"restricted\"** for datasets that require logging in. This is only relevant for accessing CPTAC-HNSCC for our purposes.\n",
        "\n",
